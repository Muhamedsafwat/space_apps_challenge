        From the colossal temples of Karnak to the serene tombs in the Valley of
        the Kings, Egypt's ancient monuments are facing unprecedented threats.
        Rising groundwater, salt weathering, and extreme temperatures are
        eroding these irreplaceable treasures. We are in a race against time to
        preserve our shared human history.
